# CS184/284A Homework Webpage Repo

The goal of this repo is to provide a template from which students can host CS184/284A homework writeups. 

## Enabling Github Pages

To enable Github pages, go to the 'Settings' tab then click on 'Pages'. Under 'Source', make sure that the branch is set to 'master' and the folder is set to 'root'. If these settings are correct, navigating to the GitHub page link should render index.html.

## Adding Homework Webpages

There are 4 folders, one for each homework. Each contains an index.html file. When the links from the mainpage are clicked, these files will be loaded, so edit these to add your homework webpages.
